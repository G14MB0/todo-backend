### Additional info

I compiled the front-end project and served in the backend as a static file.
find more info in the backend docs.

## Future Development

Just for this fast task, I made up little editing in the front end to achieve at least main backend functionalities.
Much more development can be made starting but not limited to:

- Enhance ToDo filtering
- Improved Data visualization
- Responsiveness:
    - mobile visualization
- Additional todo info (need to modify also backend)
- Improved error handling and erro UX
- Integrate Google (or others) login process

many others..
